/*
 * Hemlock Variable Resolver
 *
 * This module performs a resolution pass over the AST after parsing,
 * computing (scope_depth, slot_index) pairs for variable references.
 * This enables O(1) variable lookup at runtime instead of hash table probing.
 *
 * The resolver walks the AST and maintains a compile-time scope stack,
 * tracking which variables are defined at each scope level and their slot indices.
 * When a variable reference (EXPR_IDENT) or assignment (EXPR_ASSIGN) is encountered,
 * the resolver looks up the variable and stores the resolution info directly
 * in the AST node.
