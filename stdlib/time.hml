// Hemlock Standard Library: Time & Date Operations
// This module provides time measurement and delay functions

// ========== TIME FUNCTIONS ==========

export let now = __now;            // Current Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) as i64
export let time_ms = __time_ms;    // Current time in milliseconds as i64
export let clock = __clock;        // CPU time used by process in seconds as f64

// ========== DELAY FUNCTIONS ==========

export let sleep = __sleep;        // Sleep for specified seconds (accepts f64 for sub-second precision)
